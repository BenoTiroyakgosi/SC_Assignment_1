## Question 4

```{r, echo = TRUE}

# Generate a sequence of 10000 numbers from -2 to 2
nums <- seq(-2, 2 , length.out = 10000)

# Obtain the respective sin(x) values
sin_values <- sin(nums)

plot(nums, sin_values,
     pch  = 19,        # plot character
     main = "Graph of sin(x) for x in [-2,2]",
     xlab = "x",
     ylab = "sin(x)",
     lwd  = 3,         # line width
     col  = "red",
     las  = 1  ,       # axis 
     cex.lab = 1.4,    # axis titles
     cex.axis = 1.2   # axis tick labels
     )
